# Water Control System

## Overview
This project utilizes an MCU (Arduino Nano, in my case) to control the borehole pump and implement additional functionalities such as tank level monitoring and potentially water filter monitoring.

## Pressure Sensor Setup
To regulate the pump's on/off states, use a 3-wire pressure sensor powered by 5V. The sensor output voltage ranges from 0.5V to 4.5V, depending on the pressure. 
Some example sensor options I have used include:
- 0 to 75 psi
- 0 to 100 psi
- 0 to 145 psi

## Preventing Pump Issues
To ensure the longevity of the pump and prevent overheating, consider the following precautions:

### Minimum Time Delay
If the water pressure changes too quickly between on and off due to insufficient gas in the expansion tank, it can cause overheating. 
To mitigate this, impose a minimum time delay between turning the pump on, off, and then on again.

### Todo: Prime Loss Detection
It's advisable to incorporate a mechanism to detect if the pump has lost its prime and is running dry. Running the pump without water can also lead to overheating and damage.
Consider using 1-Wire temperature sensors, amp sensors, and/or water flow sensors to assist with this.

## Todo: Tank Level Monitoring
Implement a separate system to monitor the tank level. This will allow you to keep track of the water level and take appropriate action as needed.
* Tank level lines D9 & D10 go through a 22Î© and are also pulled to ground vi. 47k
* With two floats with break for full & make for not floating, one for the low water level and 1 for the high.
  * Then if the 1 side of the float is connected to 5V and the other to the Pin the pin will go High when the float is not floating.
  * This way it is a positive action to pull the pin High when there is not water, so with a connection problem to pump will not flood the well house.
* Or another way of saying it is if both pins are HIGH(+5V) the tank needs more water.
* And if the High float is off(i.e. NC, float is floating) turn the pum off as the tank is full
  * note the bottom float will also be floating = switch is off now, so pulled low on PCB.
  * If not should maybe halt until someone fixes the float to stop the pump turning on and off fast? Or maybe change mode to working with just the high float

1. Connect one side of the float switch to +5
2. Connect the other side to the float pin
3. In code check for both pins high to turn on pump
   1. Check for water flow and turn off pump until fixed if it's lost its prime etc.
4. Turn off pump when top float pins is low again.
5. TODO: maybe do something about just having 1 float or if 1 stops working.


## Pins:
### Some pins goe too SRV05-4-P-T7 , ESD and Surge Protection (TVS/ESD) chips
* D2 Jumper 5
* D3 Output for Second pump, goes to a transistor(2N3904: npn 200mA, 40V, 200mW), can be jumpered too second relay after transistor 2 or take to a separate relay module
* D4 Pump on
* D5 Lost prime red led
* D6 homeNet out & J5 & J14
* D7 J5, J14, LineIn for homeNetwork test 1M resistor and Zener to ground on line side, also 1M to ground
* D8, Sensor Check. Connected to A0(the psi sensor PIN) through a 47k resistor, untested pull pull low to check if sensor output stays valid or goes to 0V if bad connection etc.
* D9, Float top > GRD 47k (SRV05, TVS/ESD)
* D10, Float Lower  > GRD 47k (SRV05, TVS/ESD)
* D11, Flow sensor
* D12, 1Wire (SRV05, TVS/ESD)
* D13, LED (SRV05, TVS/ESD)
* A0(Sensor pin), D7:  > GRD 1M (SRV05, TVS/ESD)
* A1 Unused (SRV05, TVS/ESD)
* A2 Heater??
* A3 Heater??
* A4 STEMMA QT connectors I2C Data (SDA)
* A5 Stemma QT connectors I2C Clock(SCL)

* PE0 to PE3 are not connected.

## Todo: Water Filtering
Consider integrating a water filtering monitoring mechanism into the system to ensure water quality. This will help remove impurities and improve the overall water condition.

- [x] Read pump pressure.
- [x] Minimum turn on time.
- [x] LCD or some other display to show setting and state.
- [ ] Add some optional buttons to set values
- [ ] Add some sort of menu to set the turn on off pressure.
- [ ] Add temperature setup to the menu.
- [ ] Add a report problems function: cell phone text or maybe LoRa network etc.
